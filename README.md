# Spring Boot REST service

This is a Java, Maven, Spring Boot (version 2.0.3) test application that returns the balance and currency for a given user. it was created because of PAF Coding exercise.

## How to Run
This application is packaged as a war which has Tomcat 8 embedded. No Tomcat or JBoss installation is necessary. You run it using the java -jar command.
* Clone this repository
* Make sure you are using [JDK 1.8](https://www.java.com/en/download/) and [Maven 3.x](https://maven.apache.org/)
* Be sure that 8080 port is free at the moment
* You can build the project and run the tests by running 
```
      mvn clean install
```
* Once successfully built, you can run the service by one of these two methods:
```
      mvn spring-boot:run 
```       
* Check the stdout or boot_example.log file to make sure no exceptions are thrown 
Once the application runs you should see something like this
```

# About the Service
The service is just for a test project review REST service. 
You can start calling some of the operational endpoints (see full list below) like /myservice and /myservice/balance (these are available on port 8080)

You can use this sample service to understand the conventions and configurations. Once you understand and get comfortable with the sample app.

Here is what this little application demonstrates:

* Full integration with the latest Spring Framework: inversion of control, dependency injection, etc.
* No need to install a container separately on the host just run using the java -jar command
* Demonstrates how to set up healthcheck, metrics, info, environment, etc. endpoints automatically on a configured port. Inject your own health / metrics info with a few lines of code.
* Writing a RESTful service using annotation: supports both XML and JSON request / response; simply use desired Accept header in your request
* Exception mapping from application exceptions to the right HTTP response with exception details in the body
* The out put is under JSON format
```
      {
            "balance": "9",
            "currency": "X"
